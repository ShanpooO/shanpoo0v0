# Note
## Package
### Advantages
> Convinient for reusing
### Class clash
> Put the same name class into different package to distiguish functions
### Explanation
> The classes in the same package could visit each other without pointing the package name

> The classes in the same package are not necessary in the same position of the disc *(just the self-definition of the functional area)*
