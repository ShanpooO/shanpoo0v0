# Note
## Initialization
### Constructor
> Constructor is same as the name of class

> Constructor has no return value(differ from void type that you still could make it return something else)

#### Default Constructor
> If no constructor is defined, then compiler will define the default or argument constructor; if you have already defined constructor no matter what kind, the compiler will tacitly approve that you define it with yourself

### Overloading
#### 1.Method overloading
> Overloading allow the method name to be used with differencet argument types

> Method overloading also allows to use the same name for both

#### 2.Primitives overloading
> If data type is lower than argument, so the data type is promoted to the argument type

#### 3.Return value overloading(cannot recognize the specific method to realize)
